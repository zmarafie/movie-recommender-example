## Example Dataset
The notebook uses a dataset of 100 movies with the following details:
- **Genres**: Action, Drama, Comedy, Sci-Fi, Horror, Romance, Fantasy, Adventure, Animation, Crime, etc.
- **Movies**: Titles include "The Shawshank Redemption," "The Godfather," "The Dark Knight," "Forrest Gump," "The Matrix," etc.

## Example Output

Assuming the user likes these movies:
- **Liked Movies**: `The Shawshank Redemption`, `The Godfather`, `The Dark Knight`

The system outputs the following top 5 recommendations:

| **Title**                           | **Genre**   | **Average Rating** | **Recommendation Score** |
|-------------------------------------|-------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Thor: Ragnarok                      | Action      | 4.98               | 5.98                      |
| The Green Mile                      | Drama       | 4.96               | 5.96                      |
| Captain America: The Winter Soldier| Action      | 4.90               | 5.90                      |
| Schindler's List                    | Drama       | 4.84               | 5.84                      |
| Forrest Gump                        | Drama       | 4.84               | 5.84                      |

## How to Adjust for New Recommendations

### Step 1: Change the User's Liked Movies
1. In the notebook, locate the following code snippet:
   ```python
   liked_movies = ["The Shawshank Redemption", "The Godfather", "The Dark Knight"]
   ```
2. Replace the movie titles in `liked_movies` with your own preferences. For example:
   ```python
   liked_movies = ["Pulp Fiction", "Schindler's List", "Forrest Gump"]
   ```

### Step 2: Re-run the Notebook
1. After modifying the `liked_movies` list, re-run all the cells in the notebook.
2. The recommendations will update based on the new preferences.

## Adjusting the Scoring Formula

The recommendation system uses the following formula to calculate the **Recommendation Score**:

```python
RecommendationScore = GenreScore + AverageRating
```

You can adjust this formula to give more weight to certain factors, such as user preferences (GenreScore) or the movie's general popularity (AverageRating). Below are two examples.

### Example 1: Prioritize User Preferences (GenreScore)
If you want the system to prioritize movies similar to the genres of the user's liked movies, increase the weight of `GenreScore`. For example:

```python
RecommendationScore = (2 * GenreScore) + AverageRating
```

To update the notebook:
1. Locate the section where `RecommendationScore` is calculated:
   ```python
   movies['RecommendationScore'] = movies['GenreScore'] + movies['Rating']
   ```
2. Modify it to:
   ```python
   movies['RecommendationScore'] = (2 * movies['GenreScore']) + movies['Rating']
   ```
3. Re-run all cells in the notebook to apply the new formula.

---

### Example 2: Prioritize Popularity (AverageRating)
If you want to recommend movies that are highly rated across all users, increase the weight of `AverageRating`. For example:

```python
RecommendationScore = GenreScore + (2 * AverageRating)
```

To update the notebook:
1. Locate the section where `RecommendationScore` is calculated:
   ```python
   movies['RecommendationScore'] = movies['GenreScore'] + movies['Rating']
   ```
2. Modify it to:
   ```python
   movies['RecommendationScore'] = movies['GenreScore'] + (2 * movies['Rating'])
   ```
3. Re-run all cells in the notebook to apply the new formula.

---

### Testing Different Formulas
Feel free to experiment with different weights to balance personalization and popularity. For example:

- **Balanced Weighting**:
  ```python
  RecommendationScore = (1.5 * GenreScore) + (1.5 * AverageRating)
  ```
- **Focus on Genre Diversity**:
  ```python
  RecommendationScore = (3 * GenreScore) + AverageRating
  ```

Update the formula in the notebook and re-run all cells to see how the recommendations change!

---
# Advanced Customizations (Optional)
You can modify the scoring formula or introduce additional factors to adjust how recommendations are generated. Below are concepts you can add to the notebook, along with step-by-step instructions.

## Adding Genre Diversity
Encourage recommendations from underrepresented genres by penalizing overrepresented ones.

1. Locate the section where `RecommendationScore` is calculated:
```python
movies['RecommendationScore'] = movies['GenreScore'] + movies['Rating']
```

2. Replace it with:
```python
movies['DiversityPenalty'] = movies['Genre'].map(liked_genres_count) * -0.1
movies['RecommendationScore'] = movies['GenreScore'] + movies['Rating'] + movies['DiversityPenalty']
```

### Explanation:
`DiversityPenalty` adds a small penalty for movies in genres that are already highly represented in the user's liked movies.
This will promote diversity in the recommendations.

---

## Prioritizing Recent Releases
Boost the scores of more recent movies to cater to users who prefer newer content.

1. Add a `ReleaseYear` column to the dataset (if it doesn't exist) with appropriate values.
Locate the `RecommendationScore` calculation and replace it with:

```python
current_year = 2024
movies['RecencyBonus'] = (current_year - movies['ReleaseYear']) * -0.01
movies['RecommendationScore'] = movies['GenreScore'] + movies['Rating'] + movies['RecencyBonus']
```

### Explanation:
Movies released in earlier years receive a small penalty, while recent movies get a bonus.

---

## Adding Popularity Boost
Ensure highly rated movies get an additional boost in recommendations.

Modify the `RecommendationScore` calculation:

```python
movies['PopularityBoost'] = movies['Rating'].apply(lambda r: 0.5 if r > 4.5 else 0)
movies['RecommendationScore'] = movies['GenreScore'] + movies['Rating'] + movies['PopularityBoost']
```

### Explanation:
Movies with an average rating greater than 4.5 receive a boost, prioritizing highly rated content.

---

## Personalizing by Director or Cast
Include user preferences for specific directors or actors.

1. Add a `Director` or `Cast` column to the dataset.
2. Locate the `RecommendationScore` calculation and add:
   
```python
preferred_directors = ["Christopher Nolan", "Steven Spielberg"]
movies['DirectorBonus'] = movies['Director'].apply(lambda d: 0.5 if d in preferred_directors else 0)
movies['RecommendationScore'] = movies['GenreScore'] + movies['Rating'] + movies['DirectorBonus']
```

### Explanation:
Movies directed by the user's favorite directors get a bonus, improving personalization.

---

## Weighted Combination of Factors
Combine multiple factors like genre similarity, recency, and popularity with adjustable weights.

1. Modify the RecommendationScore calculation:
   
```python
movies['RecommendationScore'] = (
    2 * movies['GenreScore'] +
    1.5 * movies['Rating'] +
    1 * movies['RecencyBonus'] +
    0.5 * movies['PopularityBoost']
)
```
2. You may try to play around with the weights and see what differences it makes.
   
### Explanation:
The weights for each factor can be adjusted to balance the importance of each feature.
